## Meet Harley

Harley is a 3-year-old pointer ridgeback cross who was born in South Africa. 

She was rescued at 3 weeks old from a rural settlement just outside of Cape Town and after fostering her for a few weeks, we decided to adopt this gorgeous girl and raise her like one of our children.

She is a loyal and fun family dog who loves children - especially when they are holding food as she likes to be a bit of a snack thief! She has grown up with our 3-year-old son and 5-month-old daughter and is very protective of both.

Two years ago, when we moved to London, we flew her over to be with us. She has loved it here, especially her daily walks in Clissold or Abney park and all around Stokey.

She is very affectionate and likes to greet people and other dogs along our walks. She is a “peoples” dog and likes constant company.  She will follow you from room to room and nudge you for head scratches or tummy tickles. It sounds like a joke but she really does have separation issues and wants to be by your side all day every day.

She is well behaved except when there is wildlife around as she LOVES to chase birds, foxes, squirrels and sometimes cats.  She gets on very well with other dogs and makes friends easily.  

## Moving to Sydney

We are entering a new chapter in our lives and have been given the opportunity to move to Sydney, Australia.  Based on this, we are looking for someone special to look after our girl until she is able to join us.   

We will be leaving quite quickly but unfortunately Harley will only be able to fly from September after she waits the mandatory 6 months from her rabies vaccinations.

## So we are looking for someone who can look after her

Are you:
- A dog lover who will treat her like family
- Someone who wants constant company
- Ideally works from home during the day to be with her most of the time
- Ideally with a backyard but otherwise happy to walk her daily
- Happy to love Harley until September 2021

Of course, we don't expect you to do this for free (we would discuss payment and logistics if you are interested) but our main wish is to find the right dog lover!
