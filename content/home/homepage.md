## Meet Harley

Harley is a 3 year pointer cross born in South Africa. 

She was rescued at 3 weeks old from a township just outside of Cape Town and after adopting her we have raised her up like one of our children.

She loves children and has grown up with our 3 year old son and 5 month old daughter.

Two years ago when we moved to London we flew her over to be with us.

She is very very affectionate. She follows you room to room and nudges you for head scratches.

She is generally well behaved but likes to chase birds, foxes, cats and squirrels.

## Moving to Sydney

Unfortunately I've lost my job and we are now planning to move to Sydney to start another job. 

We will be leaving quite quickly but unfortunately Harley will only be able to fly from September after she waits the mandatory 6 months from her rabies vacinations.

## So we are looking for someone who can look after her

Are you:
- a dog lover who will treat her like family
- someone who wants constant company
- ideally works from home during the day to be with her most of the time
- ideally with a backyard but otherwise happy to walk her daily
- happy to love Harley until September 2021

Of course we don't expect you to do this for free but our main wish is to find the right dog lover!
